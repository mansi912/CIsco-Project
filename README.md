# CIsco-Project
Cisco Packet Tracer
Designed and simulated a comprehensive healthcare network in Cisco Packet Tracer, implementing a star topology and detailed subnetting across multiple departments including IT, HR, Procurement, and Staff. Configured both wired and wireless devices to ensure seamless communication and efficient data flow throughout the network. Applied professional standards and best practices in network design, addressing schemes, and device configuration. Conducted extensive testing to verify network reliability, troubleshoot issues, and optimize performance. This project enhanced my technical expertise in network architecture, IP addressing, routing, and switching, while also strengthening my teamwork, collaboration, and project management skills in a real-world simulation setting.
